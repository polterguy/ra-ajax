Ra Ajax is an Ajax Library for Mono and Microsoft ASP.NET. Ra Ajax is very 
modular meaning that parts of the JavaScript parts would easily be 
transferable to any other platforms like PHP or J2EE. If you would like 
to do so then please contact us at thomas@ra-ajax.org. It is also very
modular on the server side meaning you can easily create your own Ajax 
widgets with it. Though most people would hopefully find all their Ajax 
needs fulfilled in Ra Ajax itself. :)

Ra Ajax is the copyright of Thomas Hansen - thomas@ra-ajax.org

The license for Ra Ajax can be found on disc in the same folder as this 
file and is a pure LGPL version 3 license. Basically it says that you 
can use Ra Ajax free of charge for anything you wish including forking it.

The code model should be pretty self explaining, but if in doubt feel free
to post questions at our forum section at http://ra-ajax.org

Since the LGPL 3 is a set of additional permissions on top of the GPL3
and Free Software Foundation suggests that you should include BOTH licenses
when creating LGPL work, I have included also the GPL3 license in the file 
called "license-GPL.txt" though the main license file and the "entry point"
for understanding the license of Ra-Ajax is the "license.txt" file.

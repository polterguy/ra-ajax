* Fix Milliseconds being used consistantly across all "Timer" values in entire Ra-Ajax. Now
  some places uses Seconds as decimal value while others use Milliseconds as integer values.

* Create nAnt build script which also works on Linux

* Make Minifier logic work also on Linux. Probably not that important in the .csproj file, but should work
  in nAnt build script also on Linux.

* Implement and check ViewStateById mode on Widgets. Though not before Mono officially supports this.

* Fix the Child Rendering Logic for Container Controls. Especially Panel but make this logic
  "generic" so that it works from Ra.Widgets.RaControl class.
  Maybe implement some Stream inherited class hierarchy which are responsible for rendering
  the widgets which again can have overrides for the different modes and thereby "signal"
  to other widgets which logic to render widgets within?

* Property for "killing" Carriage Return on TextBoxes. This will be very useful
  in e.g. the InPlaceEdit since currently it does a POSTBACK if users clicks Carriage Return
  which is VERY bad...

* Fix CheckBox and RadioButton so that also e.g. OnMouseOver triggers on CONTROL and not only
  text as it does today. Maybe something like "mouseenter/mouseleave" from MooTools can help
  us here?

* Implement all the "common events" for Label and Panel and other "non-event widgets".

* Create class of JSON values instead of using dictionary like today in RaControl for
  clarity.

* In Default.aspx it sends JSON for the Value of the TextBox over too!!
  Hint; it SHOULDN'T!

* In Behaviors.aspx it send over left and top coordinates to Label, it SHOULDN'T!!

* EffectHighlight doesn't work if you haven't set explicitly a BackgroundColor...!

* Implement GetAttribute on RaWebControl

* opacity is intentionally removed from style attribute serialization, this probably should be fixed
  somehow...

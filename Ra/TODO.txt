                 TODO list for Ra-Ajax

* Fix Style serialization bug. If Control is being made invisible then the style is "discarded" while
  other ViewState values are being kept.

* Fix Milliseconds being used consistantly across all "Timer" values in antire Ra-Ajax. Now
  some places uses Seconds as decimal value while others use Milliseconds as integer values.

* Create nAnt build script which also works on Linux

* Make Minifier logic work also on Linux. Probably not that important in the .csproj file, but should work
  in nAnt build script also on Linux.

* Implement and check ViewStateById mode on Widgets. Though not before Mono officially supports this.

* Fix the Child Rendering Logic for Container Controls. Especially Panel but make this logic
  "generic" so that it works from Ra.Widgets.RaControl class.
  Maybe implement some Stream inherited class hierarchy which are responsible for rendering
  the widgets which again can have overrides for the different modes and thereby "signal"
  to other widgets which logic to render widgets within?

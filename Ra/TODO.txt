                 TODO list for Ra-Ajax

* Create nAnt build script which also works on Linux

* Make Minifier logic work also on Linux. Probably not that important in the .csproj file, but should work
  in nAnt build script also on Linux.

* Implement and check ViewStateById mode on Widgets. Though not before Mono officially supports this. (which is NOT now)

* Property for "killing" Carriage Return on TextBoxes. This will be very useful
  in e.g. the InPlaceEdit since currently it does a POSTBACK if users clicks Carriage Return
  which is VERY bad...

* Fix CheckBox and RadioButton so that also e.g. OnMouseOver triggers on CONTROL and not only
  text as it does today. Maybe something like "mouseenter/mouseleave" from MooTools can help
  us here and then trap the TOP element (span) ...?

* Create class of JSON values instead of using dictionary like today in RaControl for
  clarity. Still needs to be "overridable" for on RaControl

* EffectHighlight doesn't work if you haven't set explicitly a BackgroundColor...!

* Implement GetAttribute on RaWebControl

* opacity is intentionally removed from style attribute serialization, this probably should be fixed
  somehow...

* Create TreeView Control...

* Create Menu Control

* Fix a set of beautiful skins for all extension-controls.

* The .reRender in Control.js must take the InVisible HTML for the control

    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        I am a system developer who needs tools and have slowly grown tired of not being
        able to read, learn from and modify the tools I use. I am a Free Software advocate
        though I still think that proprietary software holds a place in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am born in 1974 and my name is Thomas Hansen. I have three kids whom I hope will 
        get to inherit a better place than what I currently can give them. I think Open 
        Source, Open Standards and Freedom of Information are some of the prime tools for
        me to succeed in leaving this place in a better shape than what is currently is in.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have been obsessed with writing system libraries large portions of my life and
        I have had a particular strong leaning towards GUI libraries. Ra Ajax is my third
        GUI library. My first GUI library was <a href="http://smartwinlib.org">SmartWin++</a>,
        my second GUI library was <a href="http://ajaxwidgets.com">Gaia Ajax Widgets</a> whom
        unfortunately was lost out of my hands some time back ago and Ra Ajax is my third
        and hopefully last GUI library. Though every time I build a new GUI library I get better
        at it, and the knowledge also learned from writing Gaia Ajax Widgets have been very 
        important for me in order to build Ra Ajax (in my opinion) perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have an intense believe in the Open Web and Ajax as the foundation for the third
        system development platform, and I feel that it is imperative that the tools for
        this platform belongs to the world and not to a specific group, organization, company
        or person.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am proud to be an <strong>Open Web Advocate and Evangelist</strong>!

    <h2>Hire me?</h2>
    <p>
        I might be available for hire if you have an interesting project that spikes my
        interest. If you're interested, please 
        <a href="mailto:polterguy@gmail.com">drop me a note</a> explaining what you'd like 
        me to do. I am highly qualified in Ajax, ASP.NET, all acronyms starting with OO and
        I have numerous times very successfully done coaching in projects which is the role
        I am most happy with. You will get most value for your money if I can coach and do 
        architectural jobs. I don't do VB.NET, Silverlight, ActiveX or WinForms development. 
        If you are unsure about whether or not you can afford me then you probably can't. 
        If you are unsure whether or not your project is interesting enough to spike my 
        interest, then it is probably not. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If I can get to use Ra Ajax you'll get an instant discount. If I can start at the 
        beginning of the project instead of 3 months past due-date you will also get an 
        instant discount. If the project is in its nature important to the world and of 
        "helping character" you will get an instant discount. If the project is an Open 
        Source projects you will get an instant discount. If I can use Ra Ajax to develop
        Open Source components which I myself can keep the copyright for you will get a 
        *MASSIVE* discount.
    </p>
    <p>
        I live in Porsgrunn/Norway but might be interested in temporary moving to attend very 
        interesting projects, especially if the location is warm, project interesting and the 
        money big. I can also work from Norway on remote locations if the project is of such a 
        character.

    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>
        Ra-Ajax is maintained by Thomas Hansen (Norway) and Kariem Ali (Egypt). We are two developers who enjoy
        building great tools for developers and with a special love for Ajax and RIA Frameworks.
    </p>

        <h2>Kariem Ali</h2>
        Kariem is from Alexandria in Egypt and have been working together with Thomas almost since the beginning
        of Gaiaware and Gaia Ajax Widgets. Kariem is born in 1982 and have previously been working a lot with
        <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> in addition to obviously also a lot of Ajax and JavaScript.
        Kariem speaks English and Arabic fluently.

        <h2>Thomas Hansen</h2>
        I am the founding father of <em>SmartWin++, Gaia Ajax Widgets and Gaiaware AS</em>. 
        I have mostly developed libraries my entire carreer and especially focused on Ajax, Open Source and 
        Open Standards. I am born in 1974 in Norway and I speak Norwegian and English fluently.
    </p>

    <h2>Hire us</h2>
    <p>
        We are both available for hire through our company Ra-Software AS which is a Norwegian company for doing 
        system development on consultancy basis. If you would like to hire us then <a href="mailto:thomas@ra-ajax.org">send Thomas an email</a>
        and explain the job you would want to get done with some few words and we'll pick it up from there.
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifications</h2>
    <p>
        We are both experts in Ajax development, and off course probably the best resources on Ra-Ajax, but in addition
        we also have expertice on different technologies like ORM, design, architecture, process, team building, DotNetNuke, 
        WinForms, C++, C#, VB.NET and practically mostly anything you can think about though with a clear bias towards 
        .Net and Mono technologies. We are available for hire either individually or as a team. Though since we have a 
        little bit of different qualifications you will often get more value for your money by hiring the both of us. You 
        will be billed by the company Ra-Software AS which is a Norwegian company located in Porsgrunn, Norway. Both of us
        have developed code for computers since long before we were teenagers.
    </p>
    <h2>Starting your project with an Ajax Starter-Kit</h2>
    <p>
        Often when you start a new project it might be difficult to know which end to start in. You may have a clea picture
        of how you want your first page to look like, but you don't really know how to "start it". We can do such jobs for you
        in such a way that we keep the copyright for the work we do anyou get free usage for the stuff we create for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then when the job is done we would create a Starter-Kit out of the solution and provide it for download to
        other customers of us. In fact all of our Starter-Kits are created using this method. And since we keep the 
        copyright for the work we do there are also incentives for us to maintain the kit meaning you'd get free updates
        to these starter-kits for 12 months running from the day you get the Starter-Sit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Price for such custom Starter-Kits starts at $500 and goes updwards to normally less than $5000 depending upon the 
        amount of work you would like to get done. For a "one pager" it would normally cost you less than $1000 while for
        something more advanced like e.g. a "CMS Starter-Kit" with full DB support and all that would cost you significantly
        more. (obviously)
    </p>
    <p>
        Still none the less you get the "cheap price" since we keep the copyright for this work, and you also get free updates
        from us since that would create incentives for us to maintain the thing for free in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        Have a look at our existing <a href="Starter-Kits.aspx">Ajax Starter-Kits</a> to see what you can expect.
    </p>
    <p>
        All existing Starter-Kits we've got are also available for purchase if you don't want to use them in "LGPL form".
        Starting from $29 which gives you full usage rights for one project with as many developers as you wish on that project.
    </p>
    <h2>Price</h2>
    <p>
        Depends upon the work you'd like to get done. Normally we can give discounts for being able to use Ra-Ajax on 
        the job and even further discounts if you can let us build extension controls for Ra-Ajax which we can keep
        the copyright for. Generally speaking the more "closed" the work is the higher the price. We are both
        very much in love with Open Source, Open Standards, Open Web technology and Open Innovation. The price range 
        can be anything between $100 per hour to $400 for more demanding jobs with less personal incentives behind them 
        for us. If we can use Ra-Ajax on a long term project keeping copyright for much of the stuff we're creating and
        being able to Open Source the end product we're most happy and you will get our cheapest price. None of us
        does Silverlight or Adobe Flash/Flex development regardless of the price you offer us.
    </p>

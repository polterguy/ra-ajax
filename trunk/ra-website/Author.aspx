    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>
        Ra Ajax is maintained by Thomas Hansen (Norway) and Kariem Ali (Egypt). We are two developers who enjoy
        building great tools for developers and with a special love for Ajax and RIA Frameworks.
    </p>
    <h2>Thomas Hansen</h2>
    <p>
        I am the founding father of <em>SmartWin++, Gaia Ajax Widgets and Gaiaware AS</em>. 
        I have mostly developed libraries my entire carreer and especially focused on Ajax, Open Source and 
        Open Standards. I am born in 1974 in Norway and I speak Norwegian and English fluently.
    </p>
    <h2>Kariem Ali</h2>
    <p>
        Kariem is from Alexandria in Egypt and have been working together with Thomas almost since the beginning
        of Gaiaware and Gaia Ajax Widgets. Kariem is born in 1982 and have previously been working a lot with
        <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> in addition to obviously also a lot of Ajax and JavaScript.
        Kariem speaks English and Arabic fluently.
    </p>
    <h2>Hire us</h2>
    <p>
        We are both available for hire through our company Ra-Software AS which is a Norwegian company for doing 
        system development on consultancy basis. If you would like to hire us then <a href="mailto:thomas@ra-ajax.org">send Thomas an email</a>
        and explain the job you would want to get done with some few words and we'll pick it up from there.
    </p>
    <h2>Qualifications</h2>
    <p>
        We are both experts in Ajax development, and off course probably the best resources on Ra-Ajax, but in addition
        we also have expertice on different technologies like ORM, design, architecture, process, team building, DotNetNuke, 
        WinForms, C++, C#, VB.NET and practically mostly anything you can think about though with a clear bias towards 
        .Net and Mono technologies. We are available for hire either individually or as a team. Though since we have a 
        little bit of different qualifications you will often get more value for your money by hiring the both of us. You 
        will be billed by the company Ra-Software AS which is a Norwegian company located in Porsgrunn, Norway. Both of us
        have developed code for computers since long before we were teenagers.
    </p>
    <h2>Price</h2>
    <p>
        Depends upon the work you'd like to get done. Normally we can give discounts for being able to use Ra-Ajax on 
        the job and even further discounts if you can let us build extension controls for Ra-Ajax which we can keep
        the copyright for. Generally speaking the more "closed" the work is the higher the price. We are both
        very much in love with Open Source, Open Standards, Open Web technology and Open Innovation. The price range 
        can be anything between $100 per hour to $400 for more demanding jobs with less personal incentives behind them 
        for us. If we can use Ra-Ajax on a long term project keeping copyright for much of the stuff we're creating and
        being able to Open Source the end product we're most happy and you will get our cheapest price. None of us
        does Silverlight or Adobe Flash/Flex development regardless of the price you offer us.

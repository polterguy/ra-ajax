    <h1>Ajax Starter-Kits - Start Flying Immediately!</h1>
    <p>
        Starter-Kits are wrapped up Visual Studio Solutions giving you a head start on your own projects. If you like 
        the design and layout of a specific Starter-Kit and you also need roughly the "same building blocks" then you
        can kickstart your project by starting out with a Starter-Kit instead of going through the 
        initial steps 
        yourself.

    </p>
    <p>
        All of our Starter-Kits are licensed as LGPL, just like the rest of Ra-Ajax, but if you're uncomfortable with 
        that then you can purchase a commercial license for any Starter-Kit you wish. This commercial license basically
        says; "Use as you wish for *one* project with as many developers as you wish, but don't sue us and don't 
        redistribute the code". You don't get any special support except like all users of Ra-Ajax you're free to post in
        our forums and such, and also you don't get updates or any customizations for your Starter-Kit. Though until
        the 1.0 release of Ra-Ajax everyone who purchase a Starter-Kit can update for free up till (including) our
        first 1.0 Release.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you wish to purchase a commercial version of a Starter-Kit then click the PayPal button below
    </p>
    <p>
        (leads you to PayPal)
        <br />
        <a href="https://www.paypal.com/_donations/?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=838418">
            <img src="media/paypal.jpg" alt="Purchase an Ajax Starter-Kit" />
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;to transfer <strong>$29</strong>, type in the name of the Starter-Kit you want in the textbox at PayPal. 
        Then when you get the receipt from PayPal, forward that receipt to 
        <a href="mailto:thomas@ra-ajax.org">thomas@ra-ajax.org</a> and we'll send you a confirmation that you can 
        use the Starter-Kit in one closed source project of your choice.
    </p>
    <h2>Why do I need to purchase while Ra-Ajax is LGPL?</h2>
    <p>
        First of all <strong>you do NOT need to purchase a commercial license of our Starter-Kits to use them</strong>, 
        if you want to use the LGPL version of our Starter-Kits then that's perfectly OK for us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though we need money to run our business and also to maintain Ra-Ajax. Second of all, the LGPL says you can link
        to LGPL code without putting restrictions on your own derived work. However a Starter-Kit is not "linking", 
        a Starter-Kit effectively *is* your application. Or at least the "beginning" of it. This means that there will 
        be a grey area for those of you who are paranoid in regards to having legal guarantees about usage and so on.
        But more importantly is the fact that you get to help us earn money on what we do, which further helps us 
        in maintaining Ra-Ajax and your Starter-Kit which in turns makes a better product for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        We think the LGPL is a great license since it effectively creates a "Free Beer" product which enables everyone
        to use Ra-Ajax regardless of their financial status. And we will (of course) not run around chasing people who 
        use our Starter-Kits through the LGPL license. But if you want to have legal guarantess which eliminate all doubt
        what so ever about your right to use your own derived code as you wish, then purchasing a proprietary license
        to use a specific Starter-Kit might come in handy. Not to mention it helps us to create a brilliant Ajax Framework
        for you :)
    </p>
    <h2>Can I purchase a proprietary license of Ra-Ajax?</h2>
    <p>
        Some developers have middle-management that denies them to use Open Source and 
        Free Software building blocks, the LGPL and MIT licenses suffer from such prejudice. If your boss is like that (or you are like that) 
        then we also sell Proprietary licenses of Ra-Ajax itself. A proprietary license of Ra-Ajax costs <strong>$98</strong>.
        Click the PayPal button above, transfer $98, forward the receipt from PayPal and we'll send you a confirmation of 
        that you can <em>"use Ra-Ajax for whatever you want inside of one legal entity (human or company) as long as you
        don't distribute the source code and you do not sue us"</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Neither the Starter-Kits nor the proprietary license of Ra-Ajax give you the rights 
        for support or updates. If 
        you need more free-of-charge support then you can use our forums (which we're truly dedicated 
        to). If you still need more support than that, 
        you should send us an <a href="mailto:thomas@ra-ajax.org">email</a> and ask us to do concultancy for you which 
        we are more than willing to do. We can also on an hourly basis modify an existing Starter-Kit for you if you wish.

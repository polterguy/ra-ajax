  I have included them here to make XCopy deployment/development
  possible. If you'd rather have them installed then edit the
  Ra.csproj file and uncomment the <Import directive to use
  the GAC version instead. This will also remove the warning
  you get when opening the project in Visual Studio.

  The MSBuild community extensions is used to minify the 
  JavaScript files used in Ra Ajax.

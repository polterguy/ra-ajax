                 TODO list for Ra-Ajax

* Fix Style serialization bug. If Control is being made invisible then the style is "discarded" while
  other ViewState values are being kept.

* Fix Milliseconds being used consistantly across all "Timer" values in antire Ra-Ajax. Now
  some places uses Seconds as decimal value while others use Milliseconds as integer values.

* Create nAnt build script which also works on Linux

* Make Minifier logic work also on Linux. Probably not that important in the .csproj file, but should work
  in nAnt build script also on Linux.

* Implement and check ViewStateById mode on Widgets.

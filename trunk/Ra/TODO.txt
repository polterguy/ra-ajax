* More effects, EffectZoom (zooms fonts)

* Add Calling server-side method from JS (http://ra-ajax.org/Forums/calling-web-method-from-javascript.forum)

* Implement and check ViewStateById mode on Widgets. Though not before Mono officially supports this. (which is NOT now)

* Calendar doesn't have nice CSS - too much IE hacks...

* EffectHighlight doesn't work on background-color:White in FF...

* Comet does not work correctly in Safari

* DateTimePicker Control

* Check to see if we can support postbascks when JS is turned OFF...

* Make sure TreeNodes has if GetChildNodes is defined ZERO "static" items defined...

* Implement setting for Tree control to NOT have clicking "anywhere" trigger expanding/collapsing but 
  rather the "plus sign" only (which if true should NOT trigger selected item changed)

* Implement "validation" on Tree control(s) meaning TreeNode MUST be child of TreeNodes, TreeNodes MUST
  be child of Tree or TreeNode and Tree and TreeNode must have [0,1] TreeNodes control etc...

* Check out to see if we can get away with less CSS manipulations in the client for expanding
  and collapsing since now three different controls have new CSS class names sent over the wire...

* Modify EffectRollDown to take absolute height of control as an OPTION. (use getDimensions or something)

* Create "delayed destroy" which uses an effect and then in the onFinished actually does the destruction...

* Property for "killing" Carriage Return on TextBoxes. This will be very useful
  in e.g. the InPlaceEdit since currently it does a POSTBACK if users clicks Carriage Return
  which is VERY bad...

* TabControl looks ugly in IE7

* Comet external raising event and setting for allowing it. GET argument raises event on page...

* SelectStart in BehaviorDraggable isn't trapped in Chrome...

* Fix CheckBox and RadioButton so that also e.g. OnMouseOver triggers on CONTROL and not only
  text as it does today. Maybe something like "mouseenter/mouseleave" from MooTools can help
  us here and then trap the TOP element (span) ...?

* Create class of JSON values instead of using dictionary like today in RaControl for
  clarity. Still needs to be "overridable" for on RaControl

* Implement GetAttribute on RaWebControl

* Create TreeView Control...

* Create Menu Control

* Fix a set of beautiful skins for all extension-controls.

* Fade effects doesn't work in Konqueror, probably setOpacity and getOpacity does something wrong...

* Dynamic.aspx doesn't work when switching controls in Konqueror. Looks like dynamically loading controls doesn't really work...

* InPlaceEdit doesn't work in Opera

* TextBox doesn't work in Konqueror

* RichEdit doesn't work in Konqueror 

* RichEdit when selecting text across formatting (italics) and doing formatting doesn't format the already formatted text...

                 TODO list for Ra-Ajax

* More effects, EffectZoom (zooms fonts)

* Implement and check ViewStateById mode on Widgets. Though not before Mono officially supports this. (which is NOT now)

* Calendar doesn't have nice CSS - too much IE hacks...

* EffectHighlight doesn't work on background-color:White in FF...

* DateTimePicker Control

* Create RollUp/Down Effect which doesn't take absolute height of control. Useful in Window
  for minimizing/restoring Window...

* Create "delayed destroy" which uses an effect and then in the onFinished actually does the destruction...

* Property for "killing" Carriage Return on TextBoxes. This will be very useful
  in e.g. the InPlaceEdit since currently it does a POSTBACK if users clicks Carriage Return
  which is VERY bad...

* TabControl looks ugly in IE7

* Comet external raising event and setting for allowing it. GET argument raises event on page...

* SelectStart in BehaviorDraggable isn't trapped in Chrome...

* Fix CheckBox and RadioButton so that also e.g. OnMouseOver triggers on CONTROL and not only
  text as it does today. Maybe something like "mouseenter/mouseleave" from MooTools can help
  us here and then trap the TOP element (span) ...?

* Create class of JSON values instead of using dictionary like today in RaControl for
  clarity. Still needs to be "overridable" for on RaControl

* Implement GetAttribute on RaWebControl

* Create TreeView Control...

* Create Menu Control

* Fix a set of beautiful skins for all extension-controls.

* Fade effects doesn't work in Konqueror, probably setOpacity and getOpacity does something wrong...

* Dynamic.aspx doesn't work when switching controls in Konqueror. Looks like dynamically loading controls doesn't really work...

* InPlaceEdit doesn't work in Opera

* TextBox doesn't work in Konqueror

* RichEdit doesn't work in Konqueror 

* RichEdit when selecting text across formatting (italics) and doing formatting doesn't format the already formatted text...

                             ChangeLog for Ra-Ajax

  *******************************************************************************

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                Version 0.8.5

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added a more "formal process" to our development cycle. This changelog is one
  example of that.
  - This means we'll have (standardly) one release maximum per week, this will be
    on Fridays. Hopefully every Friday. These are "maintenance releases".
  - Then every first Friday of every month we will have a "major release" where
    we will increase the major version number. This will make the 1.0 release hit
    the download are first Friday in January 2009 if we succeed.

* Fixed a bug with setting focus which makes IE fail if DOM element is not visible
  for some reasons (ancestor node might have display:none)
  It still fails, but at least it fails without shutting down all future Ajax and
  giving error messages.
  Relevant for Calendar Starter-Kit.

* Fixed a display bug with IE in Calendar Starter-Kit which made the "Create new 
  Activity" window show up "skewed"...

* Changed the number of nodes in our "Huge Nodes Collection" TreeView - TreeNode 
  in the TreeView sample from 500 to 200 nodes since 500 has a bad tendency of 
  crashing IE...

* Brushed up some of the styles for the sample website. Blue borders around thumbs
  etc...

* Fixed styling bug with Calendar in Combining Controls sample.

* Fixed a severe bug in InPlaceEdit which made the Text property being rendered 
  twice. This happened due to inheriting the InPlaceEdit from Label. It is now
  inheriting from Panel.

* Added support for overriding the Tag property of the Panel - just as we've had
  for a long time for the Label property. This means you can have a Panel render
  as e.g. <p></p> etc...

* Fixed a bug in Window which makes all declaratively created Behaviors (including
  BehaviorObscurer) attach to the Content control collection instead of the Window
  itself. This creates "skewed visuals" for Obscurers on Window. This means BTW
  that there is probably few if any reasons for giving the Obscurer an explicit
  ZIndex property...

* Fixed a bug in BehaviorObscurer which made it obscure also the Control it was 
  ment to make modal if there's an HTML element in the page below the Form element
  with absolute or relative position. Applies only for IE. 

* Fixed a bug in BehaviorObscurer which made it not obscure the entire document
  viewport in FireFox (and possibly other browsers too)

* Fixed a bug in BehaviorObscurer which made the obscurer NOT cover the entire 
  browser Viewport (always)
  The Obscurer now should cover the Browser Viewport for ALL browser in ALL 
  scenarios!

* Fixed a bug in EffectMove which makes IE fail when you're moving to a 
  negative value.

                             ChangeLog for Ra-Ajax

  *******************************************************************************

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                Version 0.8.5

       This version have been a seriously "stabilizer" which means that we 
       haven't added up much features but probably all users will feel that
       some parts of Ra-Ajax which had some bugs for them are now better and
       far more stable in usage.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added a more "formal process" to our development cycle. This changelog is one
  example of that.
  - This means we'll have (standardly) one release maximum per week, this will be
    on Fridays. Hopefully every Friday. These are "maintenance releases".
  - Then every first Friday of every month we will have a "major release" where
    we will increase the major version number. This will make the 1.0 release hit
    the download area first Friday in January 2009 if we succeed.

* Fixed a bug with setting focus which makes IE fail if DOM element is not visible
  for some reasons (ancestor node might have display:none)
  It still fails, but at least it fails without shutting down all future Ajax and
  giving error messages.
  Relevant for Calendar Starter-Kit.

* Fixed a display bug with IE in Calendar Starter-Kit which made the "Create new 
  Activity" window show up "skewed"...

* Changed the number of nodes in our "Huge Nodes Collection" TreeView - TreeNode 
  in the TreeView sample from 500 to 200 nodes since 500 has a bad tendency of 
  crashing IE...

* Brushed up some of the styles for the sample website. Blue borders around thumbs
  etc...

* Fixed styling bug with Calendar in Combining Controls sample.

* Fixed a severe bug in InPlaceEdit which made the Text property being rendered 
  twice. This happened due to inheriting the InPlaceEdit from Label. It is now
  inheriting from Panel.

* Added support for overriding the Tag property of the Panel - just as we've had
  for a long time for the Label property. This means you can have a Panel render
  as e.g. <p></p> etc...

* Fixed a bug in Window which makes all declaratively created Behaviors (including
  BehaviorObscurer) attach to the Content control collection instead of the Window
  itself. This creates "skewed visuals" for Obscurers on Window. This means BTW
  that there is probably few if any reasons for giving the Obscurer an explicit
  ZIndex property...

* Fixed a bug in BehaviorObscurer which made it obscure also the Control it was 
  ment to make modal if there's an HTML element in the page below the Form element
  with absolute or relative position. Applies only for IE. 

* Fixed a bug in BehaviorObscurer which made it not obscure the entire document
  viewport in FireFox (and possibly other browsers too)

* Fixed a bug in BehaviorObscurer which made the obscurer NOT cover the entire 
  browser Viewport (always)
  The Obscurer now should cover the Browser Viewport for ALL browser in ALL 
  scenarios!

* Fixed a bug in EffectMove which made IE fail if element did not have an
  explicit top or left style before effect was initiated.

* Fixed hovering bugs in IE in Accordion skins "Sapphire" and "Steel". When
  hovering in IE the skin changed to a color background which was not 
  intentionally.

* BehaviorObscurer will resize itself when browser is being resized. 
  Previously the Obscurer would never resize itself when browser was being 
  resized. This would previously make it possible to get to controls actually
  behind the obscurer. The only part left to figure out is when scrolling
  vertically...!

* Fixed height of "Create new activity" on Calendar Starter-Kit since some Safari 
  doesn't respect height style of input form elements...!

* You can now change the Visible property of TabViews inside of TabControls
  in Ajax Callbacks

* You can now change the Caption property of TabViews in Ajax Callbacks

* The TabView now have an "Enabled" property which defaults to true. If
  it is false then the TabView *cannot* bet set to the ActiveTab by 
  clicking it. You will also get visual clues in the skins of the TabControl 
  if you set this property to false...

* Added DefaultWidget property for Ra Panel (and therefore also Window etc)
  which if defined will target the widget with the given ID for being clicked 
  when Enter key is pressed when something inside that Panel has focus.
  Very useful for having default buttons being triggered when user clicks
  enter inside a Panel. Kind of the same as DefaultButton from normal ASP.NET
  Controls. Though DefaultWidget can target ANY type of Widget, including 
  CheckBoxes, DropDownLists etc in addition to Buttons. This ie because in
  Ra-Ajax also non-button controls can observe the Click event...
  When DefaultWidget is being triggered that Widget will also gain Focus.

* Fixed a bug in the internals of Ra-Ajax which made stopping events on both
  Safari and Chrome not work. This means that everything in Ra-Ajax which
  relied on being able to stop a DOM event from bubbling now works in both
  Safari and Chrome (it wasn't really that much that relied on being abl to 
  stop events though)
  Note that this only happens if you return "double false" from your JS event
  handlers as in; [false, false]...!

* Fixed so that MouseOut does NOT trigger when mouse enters a child element
  of the one handling the MouseOut event.

* Fixed so that MouseOver does NOT trigger when mouse re-enters from a child 
  element and back into the main surface of the control.

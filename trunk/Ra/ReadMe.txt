Ra Ajax is an Ajax Library for Mono and Microsoft ASP.NET. Ra Ajax is very 
modular meaning that parts of the JavaScript parts would easily be 
transferable to any other platforms like PHP or J2EE. If you would like 
to do so then please contact me at polterguy@gmail.com. It is also very
modular on the server side meaning you can easily create your own Ajax 
widgets with it. Though most people would hopefully find all their Ajax 
needs fulfilled in Ra itself. :)

Ra Ajax is hosted at; http://code.google.com/p/ra-ajax/

Ra Ajax is the copyright of Thomas Hansen - polterguy@gmail.com

The license for Ra Ajax can be found on disc in the same folder as this 
file and is an MITish kind of license. Basically it says that you can use
Ra Ajax free of charge for anything you wish as long as you;
 * DO NOT FORK THE LIBRARY!
 * DO NOT WORK FOR A GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION WHICH CURRENTLY IS 
   OCCUPYING ANOTHER COUNTRY!
If in doubt, read the license.txt file.
If you cannot obey by those two simple rules then you are free to use
Ra Ajax under the terms of the GPL version 3 which I unfortunately
cannot modify due to legal reasons.

If you want to collaborate with me by creating extension 
projects, porting Ra to PHP, J2EE or something similar then please
let me know by writing an email to polterguy@gmail.com and we'll 
probably come up with something we both will be happy about. :)

Ra Ajax is also in its entirety licensed under the GPL version 3. 
Meaning if you use Ra Ajax you can choose to use it under the MIT(ish)
license OR you can choose to use it under the GPL3 license.

See http://fsf.org for details about the GPL3 license.

PS!
Help is appreciated. I am especially interested in _DONATIONS_ since
this is what makes it possible for me to continue working on Ra Ajax.
Meaning, if you are using Ra Ajax in a commercial project and you
are earning money by using Ra, then please help me help you by 
giving me the means to continue working on improving Ra so that
you can have an ever better Ajax library when the next version of Ra
comes out.

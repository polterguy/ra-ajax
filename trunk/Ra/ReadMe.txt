Ra Ajax is an Ajax Library for Mono and Microsoft .Net. Ra Ajax is very 
modular meaning that parts of the JavaScript parts would easily be 
transferable to any other platforms like PHP or J2EE. If you would like 
to do so then please contact me first at polterguy@gmail.com since Ra Ajax
really does not allow forks unless you get some special provisions to do so.

The license for Ra Ajax can be found on disc in the same folder as this 
file and is an MITish kind of license. Basically it says that you can use
Ra Ajax free of charge for anything you wish as long as you do not FORK
the library.

The reason why I have denied forks is first of all because it fragments 
the efforts which should be focused on one code base and second of all
because when Ra Ajax is mature enough to be defined as a stable and great
product I might want to charge for a proprietary enabling license. Which
means that currently you can use Ra Ajax for free in your proprietary
code (closed source projects) but somewhere down the line I might want
to charge you for the right to use Ra Ajax in a proprietary codebase.

So instead of having 100 different forks of Ra Ajax a year from now I 
would rather see all those people working on Ra Ajax instead.

To avoid the discussion about that as long as I don't allow forks Ra Ajax
"isn't really open source" I have also licensed the entire code under the
GPL version 3. Meaning you are free to fork Ra Ajax, but only under the 
terms of the GPL version 3. Ra Ajax is Open Source and it always will be.

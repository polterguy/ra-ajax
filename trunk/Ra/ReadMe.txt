Ra Ajax is an Ajax Library for Mono and Microsoft .Net. Ra Ajax is very 
modular meaning that parts of the JavaScript parts would easily be 
transferable to any other platforms like PHP or J2EE. If you would like 
to do so then please contact me at polterguy@gmail.com. It is also very
modular on the server side meaning you can easily create your own Ajax 
widgets with it. Though most people would hopefully find all their Ajax 
needs fulfilled in Ra itself. :)

Ra Ajax is hosted at; http://code.google.com/p/ra-ajax/

Ra Ajax is the copyright of Thomas Hansen - polterguy@gmail.com

The license for Ra Ajax can be found on disc in the same folder as this 
file and is an MITish kind of license. Basically it says that you can use
Ra Ajax free of charge for anything you wish as long as you;
*DO NOT FORK THE LIBRARY*!

The reason why I have removed the right to fork Ra Ajax in the MIT 
license is because forks removes focus of Open Source projects and it
is far easier to create a great Ajax library if all are focusing
on the same codebase. Also I don't want to create competitors by 
allowing people to fork my code and create competetive projects. In
addition I am interested in getting credits for my work on Ra ;)
Also I would be really frustrated if someone else forked Ra Ajax, 
created a closed source project out of it and started charging for it.
You can use Ra Ajax for free in commercial (Closed Source) projects 
today due to the MITish license, and you can modify the code in Ra Ajax
though if you do so you cannot distribute the modified library's source.
So you have the freedom to use Ra Ajax for free in commercial and 
Closed Source projects as much as you like. Later when Ra is a mature
Ajax library with professional support and so on I *cannot* guarantee 
you that you will still be able to get updates for it enabling you 
for free to create proprietary projects using the new versions.

If you want to collaborate with me by creating extension 
projects, porting Ra to PHP, J2EE or something similar then please
let me know by writing an email to polterguy@gmail.com and we'll 
probably come up with something we both will be happy about. :)

Ra Ajax is also in its entirety licensed under the GPL version 3.

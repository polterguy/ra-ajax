
Intentions with license;
You may use this Software as you wish in both closed and Open Source projects
and you can redistribute it as you wish, but if you modify Ra you cannot 
distribute the modified version in code form. This is to prevent Ra from 
forking. You can however modify and extend Ra as much as you wish, though
then you are only free to distribute Ra in object form. This gives you the
right to modify Ra if you wish for your OWN purpose but does not enable you
to "fork" Ra. Basically this is the pure MIT X11 license with a Fork exception.

If you must fork Ra for some reasons you are free to do so though then your
forked version of Ra will have to be licensed as GPL version 3.

Also I happen to be a strong opponent of having armed troops in forreign
countries which means that if you work for a military organization then
you are NOT free to use this Software except under the terms of the GPL 
version 3 which I cannot unfortunately modify for my ethical needs.

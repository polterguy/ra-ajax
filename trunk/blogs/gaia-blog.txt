Goodbye Gaia Ajax Widgets, hello Ra Ajax


27th of December 2006 I started a folder in Subversion called <em>"Gaia"</em> which was later to become <a href="http://ajaxwidgets.com">Gaia Ajax Widgets</a>. Ever since I've been spending more than 100 hours every week working with <em>Gaia Ajax Widgets</em> in <a href="http://gaiaware.net">Gaiaware AS</a> which me and Stian Solberg together started almost 4 years ago. When we started out we were alone and we had 50% each of the company. We continued working alone for almost 2 years before Jan Blomquist and Bård Stranheim was offered an equal share of the company. And we worked basically living on Mastercards believing in a prosperous future for ourselves due to focusing on product development. I who have three kids (also at that time) and just had finished a financially and emotionally draining divorce had an especially rough time and had to take up several extra mortgages to be able to have food for myself and my kids at the time.

A couple of weeks ago I quit Gaiaware due to disagreeing with the rest of the owners in the company about the future direction for Gaia. Me and Bård Stranheim had then at that time basically been constant in each others face and one of us had to go. The others ended up believing more in Bård than they did in me. Which is quite funny since he practically haven't done anything for the company except for giving us some financial freedom which we mostly spent in a period of the company's history where we couldn't get anything constructive done due to arguing with Bård. At that time we were all arguing with Bård, me, Jan and Stian too. It even went so far that me and Jan started creating plans for how to never have Bård on board of Gaiaware again. Though it calmed down a period due to Bård deciding himself that we needed a "timeout" to focus on product development so he left temporary leaving the company in my and Jan's hands as CEOs.

It is quite a weird experience thinking about that I created Gaia Ajax Widgets. I started it in fact without even telling Stian about it. Not before I had a finished spike I told Stian since I knew he was going to become freightened due to that it was a completely new domain for us and I knew he wouldn't trust me to be able to create what Gaia later became. The 5th of February 2007, less than 40 days after I started the project we had the initial release of version 1.0 at MSDN Live in Oslo/Norway. At that time Jan Blomquist was not even a part of the company but still did a small gig for us to present Gaia during this session due to his MVP award which had made him one of the speakers at that event.

Then Jan was offered a position in Gaiaware and all though me and Stian had worked hard for almost 2 years at that time we actually GAVE him one third of the entire company due to believing in his future commits to Gaiaware.

Later I headhunted Eirik Chambe-Eng even to become a member of our board. Eirik is one of the founder and previously CEOs in <a href="http://trolltech.com">Trolltech</a> now sold to Nokia for roughly a billion NOK.

Then roughly about autumn 2007 Bård Stranheim left his job in GAT-Soft and we instantly started to headhunt him as our future CEO. First he came in as a passive investor and invested about 750,000 NOK in Gaiaware for 6% of the shares, but later we landed an agreement with him where he was going to become our CEO in addition and we gave him further 19% of the shares in the company for free so that now we were 4 equal owners of the company. At this time apart from a couple of "hand sales" done by Stian and Jan I still had done virtually *everything* in the company in regards to coding, getting press attention, building the web and doing SEO to attract visitors. Stian when I left had done about 20% of the website development and Jan had done some evangelizing, but not more than a handful of sessions and not anything in the nearby of what we where hoping for when we "hired" him earlier.

In fact Jan's greatest achievement was to put also Kariem Ali on the team which did a marvelous job helping me test the library and answer support requests in our forums and fix small bugs and such. But apart from that I had basically carried the others working more than 100 hours every week for more than 3 years without one full week of vacation during that whole period.

Though we kind of agreed on the goals, or at least the others let me do my strategy mostly without arguing against it, and I didn't really mind working so much since I felt I could really do what I wanted to do which was to create Open Web cutting-edge technology in an Open Source environment.

Due to this very ideology I even managed to get Sergey Hakobyan to move from Armenia to work with us here in Norway. Sergey I knew from before since he worked some with me on <a href="http://smartwinlib.org">SmartWin++</a> and I knew he was a brilliant developer. This proved to be the one thing which later would make them gutsy enough to move on without me since they trusted Sergey to be able to maintain and push forward the code in Gaia Ajax Widgets. None of the others in Gaiaware are able to create code that resembles mine. In fact when I met Stian he was paying for a bunch of Romanian developers to implement his ideas and when I met Jan he actually seriously believed that DotNetNuke was a "great application platform" and that stored procedures is a great way to create ORM abstractions.

When Bård Stranheim started to work in Gaiaware everything changed.

First of all we then started spending a significant amount of time in meetings, and very often these meetings where ending up in wars debating different opinions. Me and Bård pretty soon found out that we were like oil and water or fire and dynamite. This whole thing culminated in that I claimed from the others that unless Bård left the company and I was being made the CEO then I would leave. Bård, Jan and Stian thinking that Bård was a better fit than me to run the company left me no other choice than either to "prostitute" myself into becoming a "code monkey" or leaving the company. Since I have developed ideas which are incompatible with "code monkeying" the choice was natural for me.


<h3>Aftermath</h3>
It feels really weird when thinking about it in retrospective...
First of all I did more than 90% of the workload. It was my idea, I created the team, I created the strategies, I did all the marketing, and until Sergey started I did more than 95% of the development in addition to all the marketing etc. In fact I had to spend almost two months convincing Jan about that Gaia had a superior technology foundation and that it held a place even though Microsoft were creating <a href="http://www.asp.net/ajax/">ASP.NET AJAX</a> and giving it away for free.

I do not think that the others threw me over board because they wanted to be "evil" or anything like that, but I basically feel like I created something which I gave away for free to three other people and then when they disagreed with me on the future direction they threw me over board and not respecting neither my right to be a part of my own "child" growing up, neither a part of my own creation. But of course, if I think of it like that I'll grow insane so I think of it like a learning experience which brings me on to...


<h3>...lessons learned</h3>
I did only three mistakes at Gaiaware, first of all I was too afraid to start a company alone so I started a company together with Stian. BIG MISTAKE! Stian is a Jehova Witness and unfortunately very good at mixing religion into his work. Also he didn't really want to build the RIA framework of the future but had bigger dreams in regards to evangelizing "the message from God".

The second mistake was to give away one third of the company to Jan. I thought Jan was going to be a positive contributor in both regards to marketing and the code. To some extend he accomplished the first, but I still in addition to contributing *EVERYTHING* (or close to 99%, Kariem did some) to the code also contributed far more in regards to marketing than what Jan did. I did all the SEO (which brings them about 1000 unique visitors from Google every day), I did all the press releases getting attention from <a href="http://www.digi.no">digi.no</a>, <a href="htp://ajaxian.com">ajaxian.com</a> and so on and I did most of the web-design except parts of it which was being done by another friend of mine <a href="http://www.tobinharris.com/">Tobin Harris</a> which Bård demanded had to leave when he took the "timeout" period.

The third mistake was to let Bård on board. Bård is also very much a believer in Christianity and also mixed in far too much religion into the company. In addition he didn't really have the experience/qualities he needed to create what Gaiaware were supposed to become, but even more important; He didn't know he lacked these qualities! Also Bård had the "success" from <a href="http://gatsoft.no/">GAT-Soft</a> which made him further believe in his own qualities as a leader and strategist.

Bård is a friend of mine, still after this. And I have great faith in his ethics, still after this. But what he does not have is the capacity to think strategically in a "world box". Bård has never and will never obtain the qualities needed to create the RIA Framework Vendor of the 3rd Millennium...


<h3>Conclusion</h3>
First of all I will never again partner-up with people, my ideas are probably too weird or different for me being able to find anyone who will ever agree with my ideas and vision. Second of all (and more importantly) is that I will never trust Christians again. <a href="http://godisimaginary.com/">Organized Christianity</a> is a great comforter, but unfortunately also a great way to stall into the strategies of yesterday. 2000 years ago christianity was the "new and innovative thing". Today it is not! In fact I am dead set on that if Jesus saw what Christianity have developed into today he would be very angry. The ideas of Jesus is basically as far away from Christianity (the way I've experienced it with in regards to my close Christian connections) as you can possibly come. I have actually heard argument such as; <i>"sorry, but your vision is for me blasphemy since in my belief system it requires Jesus to be reborn before that will happen"</i>. Working together with Christians made me have to argue about really obscure and weird things like not being able to have the title; "Titans" on busines cards since it was considered non-Christian behavior and even the name Gaia I had to spend a significant amount of time convincing Stian about how beautiful it was since that too was an "ancient God" and the bible explicitly forbids having "other Gods than me". Christianity proved to be far thougher to fight than I could possibly imagine at the start...

Second of all I will never "give away" such greatness that Gaiaware and Gaia Ajax Widgets was. I did what I did because I trusted people, that turned out to be a BIG mistake! If you're having plans about starting a company and you believe that you have Grand Ideas then DO IT ALONE! Do NOT partner with other people who have "lesser ideas" than you. They WILL eventually destroy you! Even though you don't think that now.


<h3>Future for Gaia</h3>
I think that Gaiaware have about 50% chance of "succeeding" into becoming a <a href="http://www.telerik.com/">Telerik</a> II or <a href="http://www.infragistics.com/">Infragistics</a> II. A platform vendor for the 3rd Millennium however which was my plans is though completely out of the window. With some luck and very hard work though I think Bård might have the capacity to bring them into 50 employees working as MSFT wannabees for about 5-15 years ahead. <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">Mono</a> story is probably out the window though, at least with time. They will probably integrate closer and closer with Visual Studio and other Microsoft specific technologies and Mono will slowly suffer and eventually become history. Not before it is too late they will discover the importance of supporting BOTH platforms. Open Source and Open Standards will suffer. I will not be surprised if they start creating closed source Silverlight components in fact. I do not believe in Gaiaware without Thomas Hansen. (me)


<h3>Future for me</h3>
So I move on, but as I said previously I don't think the others did what they did out of evil. I just don't think they have 20/20 vision, in fact more like 1/1 vision. I think they did what they feel is the best for the company, though obviously I completely and insanely disagree with their conclusion. 

<b>I am NOT finished with Ajax libraries for ASP.NET though</b>, in fact I have just barely started. I created the initial implementation of Gaia Ajax Widgets in less than 2 months, and now I know all the wrongs I did the first time which means that I have the capacity and knowledge to build an Ajax library way better than the first time I did it. I have already started and the product name is <b>Ra Ajax</b>. It is though at a pretty early stage, but it already have ideas which far surpasses the ideas in Gaia Ajax Widgets. For one it's a complete base component foundation and it contains less than 15KB of JavaScript. And with Gaia probably moving into tight coupling with MSFT the market will be wide open for me to build the next RIA Platform. And this time I am going SOLO! I will hire when I can afford, but I will never "partner". This also have the benefit of letting me focus on coding and marketing instead of quarrelling and arguing. In addition the company will be based on MY standards instead of a lot of compromises. Which again means <b>"as open as possible", "as free as possible" and "as informative as possible"</b>. You can already find some code at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ra-ajax/">Google Code project site</a>.

I set myself back three/four years by choosing the wrong people to work with, I will not repeat that mistake again. To quote a great guy (Steve Jobs); <i>"What can I say, I hired the wrong guy"</i>.

So I will create an Ajax Library for ASP.NET and Mono, documenting 100% of the road and MIT(ish) licensing the whole thing. And the most important thing is that it will be <b>100% based on Open Innovation</b>. I am a serious believer in the <b>Open Web</b>!

This is the last time I'll talk publicly about the internals behind my leaving of Gaia Ajax Widgets since I am focusing on the FUTURE instead of the past now. But I feel it is important to let others know why and how I left Gaiaware. First of all as "self medication" and second of all because I am a fanatic believer in "Open Information" too and third of all because I think there are lessons to be learned for others here.

So all that's left to say now is; 
<b>"Goodbye Gaia Ajax Widgets and Hello Ra Ajax" :)</b>

PS!
If you disagree with my conclusion in regards to the future of Gaiaware I still own 25% of the company and I am more than willing to sell my shares if the price is right.

Until next time, have a nice day :)


Thomas Hansen

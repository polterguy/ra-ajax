    <p>
        Ra-Software, the company behind Ra-Ajax is a <em>Software Factory</em>. This means that
        we can create software for you. We all define ourselves as <em>Software Creators</em>.
        If you need software created or you have some problems which we can solve for you, then please
        send <a href="mailto:thomas@ra-ajax.org">us an email</a> and explain what you would
        want to get done.
    </p>
    <p>
        Things we can do...
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Create websites for your company</li>
        <li>Create applications for your company</li>
        <li>Adopt entire suites of web applications for you</li>
        <li>And many more things...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Then your company can do what it knows best, create specifications, talk to customers, 
        market and sell the software. While a highly specialized and extremely skilled <em>Software Factory</em>
        can assemble the software for you. This has been a natural part of conventional industry 
        for more then 150 years, we in Ra-Software think it's time to do this for Software too.

    <h2>Why so many Software Project fails...</h2>
    <p>
        Software Development is a craftsmanship-skill many people claim to posess, but few are able to 
        master. Kind of like masonry used to be hundreds of years ago.
        Think of it like this; Music Artists and Painters don't create their own instruments
        or paint and Toys'R'Us and MacDonalds don't manufacture their own toys or grow their own potatoes. 
        So why should not a Software Company have a specialized <em>Software Factory</em> create
        their Software.
    </p>
    <p>
        Or think of it like this; Software is highly complex and difficult to create, so why should
        the process of creating your software be given to randomly chosen self proclaimed Software 
        Developers - nobody in your company are able to evaluate the skills of?
    </p>
    <p>
        According to several international studies about <strong>75% of all software projects
        fails</strong>. Ra-Software does not fail. If we chose to create software for you then 
        we know we will be able to deliver the expected results, within the expected budget at the 
        expected time.

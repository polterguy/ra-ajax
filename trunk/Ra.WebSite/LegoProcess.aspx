    <h1>The Lego Process</h1>
    <p>
        The <em>Lego Process</em> is a process that seriously reduces the development costs 
        for Software. The basic concept is that instead of building Applications as Monolithic beasts,
        the Lego Process breaks these applications down to several smaller units, where each unit by 
        itself is highly managable and easy to understand. This creates more flexibility and less 
        costs for your customers.

        To make it really easy for you to understand and verify our claims, we have created a 
        <em>Lego Process Manifesto</em> that explains the entire process in details. The Lego 
        Process Manifesto is licensed as Creative Commons, which means you can distribute it as you wish
        and you are also free to adopt the ideas in it yourself. Ra-Software uses the Lego Process

Ra-Ajax are doing consulting. And if you hire us as consultants you will 
be given the right to use Ra-Ajax in proprietary software in a non-GPL 
license. Or "commercial" license if you like.

If you are interested in hearing about our consulting offerings, then
please send an email to thomas@ra-ajax.org explaining your case. We
can do both small and large consulting jobs.

Examples of what we can do include;
 * Coaching
 * Code Reviews
 * Development of entire systems and applications
 * Teaching

But we can mostly do anything even remotely associated with system 
development.

We operate physically in Sacramento US, Oslo/Telemark Norway and 
Alexandria in Egypt. However we can also do virtual consulting 
through means such as Skype, email and such. All non-Norwegian 
customers will be billed through PayPal.

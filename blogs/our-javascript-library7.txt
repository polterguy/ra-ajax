How to create an Ajax Library part 7 - The JavaScript parts finished


We are now finished with our <em>Ajax JavaScript library</em> and the next step is to start building the server-side gluing in addition to our Ajax Control JavaScript class(es). But all the JavaScript "core" parts are now finished. This is a great place to recap a little bit and quickly run through what we have done so far.
<ul>
	<li>In our first chapter of this book we walked through the <a href="how-to-create-an-ajax-library-part-1-decisions.blog">decisions when creating an Ajax Library</a>. Here we set the "basic architectural decisions" for our Ajax Library and later we just executed on the JavaScript parts of those decisions.</li>
	<li>Then in our second chapter we walked through the <a href="how-to-create-an-ajax-library-part-2-the-basic-javascript-oo-concerns.blog">basic JavaScript OO concerns</a> when creating a JavaScript library which just helped us by giving us some basic syntax for our JavaScript code. This article is the by far most important one and crucial for you to understand if you want to understand code in any other articles in this book. In this article we walked into creating classes and having inheritance and even multiple inheritance in JavaScript.</li>
	<li>In our third chapter we discussed the <a href="how-to-create-an-ajax-library-part-3-the-element-class-and-the-function.blog">Element class and our $ function</a> which was the wrapper classes/functions we needed to manipulate DOM elements.</li>
	<li>Then we created a basic <a href="how-to-create-an-ajax-library-part-4-creating-a-javascript-effect-class.blog">Effect class</a> for adding up some DHTML "candy" for our library.</li>
	<li>Then we walked through the <a href="how-to-create-an-ajax-library-part-5-wrapping-the-xmlhttprequest-xhr-object.blog">XMLHTTPRequest object</a> in our fifth chapter. And we even talked a little bit about "the greatest cowboy of our times" (Jesse James Garrett, sorry Garrett if you don't like that label, but believe me it is given with respect and love ;) and talked about the history of the XHR object.</li>
	<li>Then we walked through <a href="how-to-create-an-ajax-library-part-6-serializing-your-forms.blog">how to serialize form elements</a>.</li>
	<li>And finally our last pure JavaScript chapter was <a href="how-to-create-an-ajax-library-part-7-the-ra-ajax-class.blog">the Ra.Ajax class</a>. Or how to and why queue up Ajax Requests towards the server.</li>
</ul>
And that was about it, after this chapter most of our code will be closely coupled towards ASP.NET and WebControls which means that if you're developing for anything else than ASP.NET and WebControls then you should expect parts of the next chapters to be "off topic". However, I think you still will be able to find a lot of "gold" for your Ajax Library none the less, so I encourage you to follow up also on the ASP.NET parts of our book.

Remember that <em>creation is just discovering what's already there waiting to be found</em> and that I have done a lot of discovering in the concept of Ajax due to having worked with Ajax a lot and created both Gaia Ajax Widgets and Ra Ajax.


Have a nice day, and in case I don't see you a nice evening and night too until we meet again :)

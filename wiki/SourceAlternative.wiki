UPDATE 6th of March 2009: Due to a Temporary Precautionary Measure verdict court of first instance we have to remove Ra-Ajax while the lawsuit proceeds. Therefore, we have removed the download options for Ra-Ajax.

In addition, we will not sell, market or publish Ra-Ajax from this day forward until this lawsuit is settled. Therefor some pages have been removed so that they are impossible to read. This page are among these pages.

We hope that this will just be a minor hick up, and we believe that we'll get to publish Ra-Ajax again when this lawsuit is finished. First, we will appeal this temporary verdict to the court of second instance.

Note that if you have already downloaded Ra-Ajax you are free to use it legally under the terms of the LGPL version 3.

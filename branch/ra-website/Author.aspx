    <h2>Qualifications</h2>

        We are both experts in Ajax development, and of course probably the best resources in the world on Ra-Ajax - since we
        are creating it, but in addition we also have expertice on different technologies like ORM, design, architecture, 
        process, team building, DotNetNuke, WinForms, C++, C#, VB.NET and practically anything you can think about though 
        with a clear bias towards .Net technologies. We are available for hire either individually or as a team. You will 
        be billed by the company Ra-Software AS which is a Norwegian company located in Porsgrunn. Both of us have developed 
        code for computers since long before we were teenagers. We can do mostly anything 
        that has to do with System Development, including Training, Coaching, development, projects, management, C#, VB.NET, 
        C++, Web, WinForms etc...

    <h2>Hire community members</h2>
    <p>
        In addition to ourselves we also have a growing community of dedidacted users, contributers and evangelists
        whom some of are also available for hire. Often you might even get lucky and find someone who lives just next to
        your own business which makes it possible for you to actually easily see these people without having to organize
        a flight across half the world. And in some occassions these community members have slightly different profiles
        than us which might fit you better than hiring us. Below you can find some of these dedicated
        Ra-Ajax community members. Most of them use Ra-Ajax on a daily basis.

    <h2 style="clear:both;">Starting your project with an Ajax Starter-Kit</h2>
    <p>
        Often when you start a new project it might be difficult to know which end to start in. You may have a clear picture
        of how you want your first page to look like, but you don't really know how to "start it". We can do such jobs for you
        in such a way that we keep the copyright for the work we do and you get free usage for the stuff we create for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then when the job is done we would create an <a href="Starter-Kits.aspx">Ajax Starter-Kit</a> out of the solution and 
        provide it for download to other customers of us. In fact all of our Starter-Kits are created using this method. 
        And since we keep the copyright for the work we do there are also incentives for us to maintain the kit meaning 
        you'd get free updates to these starter-kits for 12 months running from the day you get the Starter-Sit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Price for such custom Starter-Kits starts at $500 and goes updwards to normally less than $5000 depending upon the 
        amount of work you would like to get done. For a "one pager" it would normally cost you less than $1000 while for
        something more advanced like e.g. a "CMS Starter-Kit" with full DB support and all that would cost you significantly
        more. (obviously)
    </p>
    <p>
        Still none the less you get the "cheap price" since we keep the copyright for this work, and you also get free updates
        from us since that would create incentives for us to maintain the thing for free in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        Have a look at our existing <a href="Starter-Kits.aspx">Ajax Starter-Kits</a> to see what you can expect.
    </p>
    <p>
        All existing Starter-Kits we've got are also available for purchase if you don't want to use them in "LGPL form".
        Starting from <strong>$29</strong> which gives you full usage rights for one project with as many developers as 
        you wish on that project. To purchase existing Starter-Kits, go to our <a href="Starter-Kits.aspx">Ajax Starter-Kits</a>
        page and see if there's something tempting you there :)
    </p>
    <h2>Price</h2>
    <p>
        We are expensive! At least if you think of what you're paying us per hour of work we're doing. But System Development
        is not like conventional engineering. System development is a highly creative work and the more experience and passion
        you've got for it the better you are at delivering value for your customers. I think Paul Graham is perfectly correct
        when he says that; <em>"95% of all great projects and code on the planet is delivered by 5% of all the developers"</em>.
        And we (Thomas &amp; Kariem) definitely belong to that 5% lot...
    </p>
    <p>
        After all, when developers get stuck, they come to us...
    </p>
    <p>
        This is why we prefer to not work on an per hourly basis, but rather deliver fixed cost prices to our customers because
        then they can compare the cost of the value they're getting from us with the value others are giving for the same price.
        Then if we spend a fraction of the time delivering the same or higher value and at the same time spending a fraction of
        the time delivering that value - then you earn on the end product - while we get higher rates than "the average".
    </p>
    <p>
        So while yes, we are "expensive", but still "expensive" is often more cheap. Who would you take financial advice from
        if you could choose between getting it for free from your grandma or pay Warren Buffet $1000 per hour? Or who would you
        have paint your ceiling, Michelangelo for $1000 per hour, or your nephew for $10 per hour? Who do you think would end
        up being more expensive for you?
    </p>
    <p>
        Also when you deliver IT systems the real cost of that system is maintenance, 80% in fact according to several financial
        analytics companies. We deliver high quality code for you which you can live with for years and which will "just work" 
        for you for a very long time to come.
    </p>
    <p>
        So while we are expensive "per hour" we are *very* cheap when you conside the total cost of ownership of your solution.
        When we deliver, you get satisfied! For YEARS to come!
    </p>
    <p>
        If you've got a project you wish us to look into for you then <a href="mailto:thomas@ra-ajax.org">send us an email</a>
        and explain with some few words what you would want us to do and we'll pick it up from there :)
    </p>

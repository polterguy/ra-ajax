                Ra-Ajax - and Ajax Library for ASP.NET and Mono

***********************************************************************************************

* Ra-Ajax is licensed under the LGPL version 3 and can be used 
  free of charge in proprietary projects. (Closed Source projects)

* The pre-built library DLLs exists within the "library" folder and
  are the ones that should be used in your projects since they are
  minified and optimized.

* In the "resources" directory you can find the ResourceCacher.dll
  which if configured correctly in Web.Config will add up a "far 
  future expires" date for your CSS and images and other static 
  content.

* You will also find the "Ra.Build.Tasks.dll" within the "resources"
  directory which is an nAnt task to minify JavaScript. Feel free
  to use this DLL in your own projects.

* If you wish to rebuild the library this must be done using nAnt
  and the "Ra.build" script which will minify the JS for you using
  the "Ra.Build.Tasks.dll".

* If you just want to test Ra-Ajax locally then for Windows systems
  this can be easily done by opening the Ra.sln file in Visual Studio
  and hit F5 to start the Samples website.
  In Mono on Linux use the xsp2 command from a command line within the
  samples directory and browse to http://localhost:8080/

* All project files should be compatible with MonoDevelop, Visual
  Studio 2005 and Visual Studio 2008.

* If you find bugs then report them in our forums at 
  http://ra-ajax.org/Forums/Forums.aspx


Have a nice day :)

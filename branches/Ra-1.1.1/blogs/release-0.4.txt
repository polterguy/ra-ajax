I have just released a new version of Ra-Ajax which can be found at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ra-ajax/">Google Code project site</a>. Of the more important changes is that now finally I have a <a href="http://ra-ajax.org/samples/">sample website</a> which doesn't require you guys to also install MySQL. You still you need to have MSBuild Community Tasks installed though. You can remove this from the csproj file called Ra.csproj or you can install it from <a href="http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/">Tigris.org</a> (it's BSD licensed). The task I am using is using JSMin to minify the JavaScript so without it you'll have to minify the JavaScript yourself (or accept extra "browser bandwidth usage" for your JavaScript)

Some of the other changes I have done is that all widgets that logically needs them now have server-side events for;<ul><li>Blur</li><li>Focus</li><li>MouseOver</li><li>MouseOut</li><li>MeyUp</li></ul>This means that you can now trap most of the JavaScript DOM events with the same names in your server-side Event Handlers. There are also some examples of that at the <a href="http://ra-ajax.org/samples/Flexible.aspx">Sample Ajax Event System</a>.

I have tried to write the <a href="http://ra-ajax.org/samples/">samples for Ra-Ajax</a> as a "story" which tries to explain the important points of Ra-Ajax as you progress. This does reduce the "bling" of the samples a bit, but I hope it will make it easier to start using Ra-Ajax.

Also finally the registration process at the <a href="http://ra-ajax.org/Forums/Forums.aspx">forums</a> works. All though still not "bullet proof" I hope it will work for most people. If it doesn't work then please <a href="mailto:thomas@ra-ajax.org">send me an email</a> and I'll try to help you :)

BTW for those that didn't understand the point with the above pyramid it's a testimonial in regards to that Ra-Ajax is *STILL* BETA. Snefru was a bright guy, and the first Pyramid builder, but he had to try three times before managing to get the pyramid construction "right".

Also I am currently trying to get a "slogan" for Ra-Ajax, what I have been thinking of are one of these;<ul><li>"Building Software for the next 5000 years"</li><li>"Building blocks for the next 5000 years"</li><li>"The stuff the Pharaos would have used if they had it"</li></ul>
...and so on. If you have a suggestion please either drop me a note or comment on any of the places where this article is published since I don't have a comment system working on my blog just yet :)
(You can try to comment in the forums section though, but all though the forums are "working" they are still not 100% stable)

PS!
For thos wondering about how "<a href="http://ra-ajax.org/being-sued-by-gaiaware-and-b-rd-stranheim.blog">the case</a>" is going I am trying not to speak too much publicly about it for a lot of different reasons, but you will get an update about it soon. Hopefully something which puts things to a rest and makes everything work out OK :)

PS2!
To all that gave me advice, sympathy declarations and so on I'd like to say thank you a lot. I have followed many of your advices and your sympathy declarations made me grow a chest :)

Oh yeah, almost forgot, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ra-ajax/">here are the goods</a> (download of Ra-Ajax :)

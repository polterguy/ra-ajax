    <h1>Donate to the Gaiaware, Gaia Ajax and Bård Stranheim law suite fund</h1>
    <p>
        Thomas Hansen (me) the creator of Ra-Ajax is <a href="xxx">being sued by Gaiaware and Bård Stranheim</a>
        due to that Gaiaware and Bård Stranheim does not want me to develop LGPL licensed and free of charge Ajax
        Libraries for ASP.NET. Read the entire story in this sequence:
    </p>

    </ul>
    <p>
        In this battle for the freedom to pursue our dreams and doing what we feel is the right thing to do, we need your
        help. A law suite like this is not cheap, the estimated price of it according to my lawyer is roughly $25,000 and while
        Bård Stranheim has roughly $10,000,000. Me, Kariem and Ra-Software have roughly $0 (zero)
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefor me, Kariem and more importantly Ra-Ajax which collectively is underneath the company Ra-Software AS
        need your help. Click the below PayPal button to donate to the law suite fund.

        This is effectively a war on Ra-Ajax' right to live on as an LGPL project and a free of charge Ajax library for ASP.NET
        developers. And when everything else is taken away, this is really about whether or not I am free to do what I see fit
        and what me and Kariem believe is the best thing for the world. Bård Stranheim believes that my actions and Ra-Ajax is
        damaging to him and his ability to earn money on selling licenses on <em>Gaia Ajax</em> - but that is not really my
        problem. He can easily solve that by creating better Ajax libraries for ASP.NET than me and Kariem. To try to stop
        Ra-Ajax as a project by suing us and forcing us to stop developing Ra-Ajax is not the right way to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will periodically blog about how much money have been raised and updates on the law suite. You can subscribe
        to my blog from here; <a href="http://ra-ajax.org/thomas.blogger?rss=true">Thomas Hansen's blog</a>.

        We also need help in any ways you can give. Some suggestions here is that you can write about this in blogs, you can link
        to this page in your email signatures, tell your friends, you can write about this in forums and other places. We need the
        truth to get out there! You can also contribute by being an expert witness for us to help us prove that Ra-Ajax is not an
        "extension" or "off-spring" from Gaia Ajax Widgets - whatever that means. You can give us hints and tips about how to fight
        this battle if you are experienced in such cases or any other ways you see fit to help our cause. Only by mobilizing the
        masses and standing together in this battle for freedom and against injustice we can win!

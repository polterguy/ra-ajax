<h3>Aim of this tutorial</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Get you started with using the Extension Controls library</li>
	<li>Teach you the basics of the Ra-Ajax skinning model</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
	<li>That you have read and understood the previous tutorials in this series</li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>
	So far except for some Effects and Behaviors we have only used the "core controls" of
	Ra-Ajax. This time we will dive into some of the more "rich" controls that exists in
	the Extension Project.
</p>
<p>
	Start out by creating an ASP.NET Website just like in the previous tutorials, but this
	time make sure you also reference and include the <i>Extensions.dll</i> since this
	dll is the place of all the more "rich" controls like
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Window</li>
	<li>Timer</li>
	<li>Calendars and DateTimePickers</li>
	<li>plus many more...</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Code follows...
</p>
<pre lang="xml">
<%@ Register 
    Assembly="Ra" 
    Namespace="Ra.Widgets" 
    TagPrefix="ra" %>

<%@ Register 
    Assembly="Extensions" 
    Namespace="Ra.Extensions" 
    TagPrefix="ext" %>
</pre>
<p>
	Now you can reference all the Extension Controls by typing in <i>&lt;ext:</i> in your .ASPX
	markup.
</p>

<h3>Creating a Modal Window</h3>
<p>
	We're going to create a Modal Window in this tutorial which will open only when the 
	user clicks a button, and initially be rendered as in-visible. Copy and paste the code 
	below into your website code files.
</p>
<b>Default.aspx</b>
<pre lang="xml">
<ra:Button 
    runat="server" 
    ID="btn" 
    Text="Click me..." 
    OnClick="btn_Click" />
<ext:Window 
    runat="server" 
    ID="wnd" 
    style="position:absolute;left:50px;top:50px;z-index:50;"
    Caption="Hello World Window"
    Visible="false">
    <div style="padding:15px;">
        Howdy world! I'm BACK...!
    </div>
    <ra:BehaviorObscurable 
        runat="server" 
        ID="obsc" />
</ext:Window>
</pre>
<b>Default.aspx.cs</b>
<pre lang="cs">
protected void btn_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    wnd.Visible = true;
}
</pre>

<h3>The two second guide to skinning and CSS in regards to Ra-Ajax</h3>
<p>
	If you tried to run this now you would see that nothing looks like it is supposed
	to look like. This is because we haven't included any <i>skin CSS files</i>. You can
	easily do this by copying and pasting the <i>skins</i> folder to your root website
	folder and add the inclusion of the <i>Steel CSS file</i> like we have done below.
</p>
<pre lang="xml">
<head runat="server">
    <title>Untitled Page</title>
    <link href="skins/steel/Steel.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
</head>
</pre>
<p>
	Most Extension Controls relies on skins to render correctly. Ra-Ajax is distributed
	with several skin files included, but you can also easily create your own skins by
	modifying existing ones. These skins are just CSS. And coupled with the <i>inspect</i> 
	feature from FireBug, it is actually very easy to create your own skins.
</p>
<p>
	The skin CSS files in Ra-Ajax are all built in the same way, the <i>Window skin</i>
	is within the <i>.window</i> parts of the CSS files. And the Calendar skin within the
	<i>.calendar</i> parts of the CSS files. And so on...
</p>
<p>
	When you have included the CSS file for your skin, you can click F5 and test your 
	application. You should be able to see something like this.
</p>
<img src="tutorials/rich-controls-tutorial.jpg" alt="Modal Ajax Window with Ra-Ajax" />
<p>
	If you don't get something looking similar to the above image, then you have probably
	not included the skin CSS file correctly. Make sure your paths are correctly set up
	to point to the CSS file of your choice...
</p>
<p>
	The reason why the Window is <i>modal</i> is because we have added the <i>BehaviorObscurer</i>
	within the content parts of the Window. If you don't want to have a Modal Window then
	just remove the BehaviorObscurer and the Window will become "non-modal".
</p>
<p>
	The BehaviorObscurer can be set for <b>any</b> control you wish. Even Buttons if you wish.
	Though if you use it your Control <b>must</b> have an explicit <i>z-index</i>. Without
	an explicit z-index then the obscurer will probably also obscure the control it is added to
	since the obscurer will add an explicit z-index itself with one value lower then whatever
	z-index value you choose for its parent control.
</p>

<h3>About the Extension Controls</h3>
<p>
	Most Extension Controls (like the Window above) are entirely created without resorting
	to JavaScript. This is a pretty strong testimonial towards the extremely strong
	code-model of Ra-Ajax. Even most of our own Ajax Controls are created without having
	to develop in JavaScript ourselves.
</p>
<p>
	If you want to create your own Extension Controls then probably the Extension Control 
	library, and also probably the <i>Window.cs</i> file within here will prove a very 
	valuable resource for you to start out with.
</p>
<p>
	The Window Control have tons of useful properties. It has a <i>Caption</i> and a
	<i>Movable</i> property and it also have many more. But the Window control is
	only one of many controls within the Extension Controls library. In addition
	to the Window there are many more Controls that exists within the Extension 
	Controls library. Here is a small subset of those controls.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Calendar and DateTimePicker</li>
	<li>Timer</li>
	<li>Tree (TreeView Control)</li>
	<li>Menu</li>
	<li>SlidingMenu</li>
	<li>Extended Button</li>
	<li>And many, many more...</li>
</ul>
<p>
	And <b>*ALL*</b> of them are heavily documented, with good examples above in the 
	<i>Class Browser</i>.

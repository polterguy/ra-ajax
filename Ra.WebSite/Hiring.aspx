    <h1>Virtual Employee</h1>
    <p>
        Ra-Software is experiencing growth due to our <a href="SoftwareFactory.aspx">Software Factory Concept</a>
        and we have a model where we can offer you to have all the benefits of belonging to a company, while at the
        same time you effectively work as your own boss and you feel as if you work for your own company. 
        We refer to this concept as <em>Virtual Employees</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have branches in Egypt, Norway and California, but really where you live in this world doesn't
        really matter that much since we expect you to work mostly from your home anyway.
    </p>
    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>You get to chose exactly how much you want to work</li>
        <li>You will earn way more money per hour invested then previously</li>
        <li>You get access to the best software-tools and software-minds in this world</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>We need from you</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>To have an entrepreneur mindset</li>
        <li>To have seriously high abilities in regards to System Development</li>
        <li>To be risk-averse</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
        You basically work as a free consultant on your own, though with a complete organization behind you
        backing you if you're stuck, training you when needed and supplying you with the best web-application
        development tools imaginable. In addition you don't have to do any of the paper work needed to set
        up a company, file tax-reports and hire accounting and administrative personal, etc. Then when you 
        do consultancy work, we do the billing, we have an existing company with accountance people and 
        an administration and all the parts that are problematic when creating a company of your own. 
        We deduct a fixed percentage of your income needed to run the administration and develop and maintain 
        our tools, and send the rest to you as normal salary.
    </p>
    <p>
        This means that if you want to go wind-surfing at Hawaii for three months, we'll say; "Have a blast".
        It also means that if you work 100 hours per week, billing $150 per hour, you'll get to cash out several
        Lamborghinis after merely a month or two.
    </p>
    <h2>What we expect</h2>
    <p>
        We will occassionally be able to find work for you, either solo work for one of our customers or work 
        in larger projects creating modules and such. But it is also expected from you to find
        your own work, hence the importance of you being a positive and extrovert entrepreneur, in addition
        to being a really great developer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Language and platform experience is not really important, but a general idea of modular development
        is a bonus. We also exclusively use our own in-house developed web-application framework built on
        top of .NET/Mono. Knowledge of Ra-Ajax is expected. Knowledge about CSS, HTML and Ajax is also expected.
        All work will be solely web-applications for other companies. In fact what you're willing to say no
        to are of high importance. We do not do projects where we cannot use our own tools, which means
        no desktop-applications, no Flash, no jQuery projects, no Silverlight, etc. All of our projects
        are built purely with Ra-Ajax and our own modular based web-application framework which you will be granted 
        access to when starting.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is also expected of you to sign a CLA (Copyright License Agreement) before starting. Though you
        can work on any "spare time projects" you wish, doing whatever you wish with the copyright to
        those projects.
    </p>
    <h2>What we can give you</h2>
    <p>
        A belonging to a big organization where you can harvest the knowledge of others. We'll also occasionally
        throw training-courses in all kind of subjects ranging from <em>"How to sell hours"</em> to 
        <em>"How FireBug works"</em>. You will also get to associate yourself with Ra-Software, an existing 
        software company with a well known name and brand and a lot of existing customers and testimonials to help 
        sell yourself. You'll get to market yourself through our website, you'll get all the stuff you need
        to do your job like Business Cards etc. We do all the administrative work for you, even though it feels
        like you're working as a free consultant. But most important is that you'll get close to 100% freedom
        in regards to deciding when, how and who you want to work for. If you insist on doing all your software 
        development solely between 01AM and 06AM, we'll say; OK! You also get the freedom to decide yourself
        how much you want to work and hence how much money you want to earn. If you can find good paid work
        working 60 hours per week then a monthly salary of $10,000 is within reach.
    </p>
    <h2>We need you! (...maybe!)</h2>
    <p>
        Ohh yeah, and this is obviously not something for everyone. However if you get that feeling of a 
        rush going through your body when reading the stuff above and you feel that good nice feeling of 
        an adventure rising in the horizont by seeing this page, then you're probably the one we're looking for...
    </p>
    <p>
        If this sounds interesting, then please send <a href="mailto:thomas@ra-ajax.org">thomas an email</a>
        and give us your pitch in regards to why we should hire just you. Remember we're buying into you, 
        not the other way around ... ;)

    <h1>Software Factory</h1>
    <p>
        Ra-Software, the company behind Ra-Ajax is a <em>Software Factory</em>. This means that
        we can create software for you. If you have some piece of software or website you would
        want to create then we can create it for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will then use Ra-Ajax in this project and you will be given a special <strong>proprietary license
        of Ra-Ajax</strong> which does not restrict your project in any ways by the GPL. So if you need to
        have some software created or you have some problem which we can solve for you, then please
        send <a href="mailto:thomas@ra-ajax.org">Thomas an email</a> and explain what you would
        want to get done.
    </p>
    <p>
        Things we can do...
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Create websites for your company</li>
        <li>Create applications for your company</li>
        <li>Create modules for an existing website</li>
        <li>Create DotNetNuke modules for you</li>
        <li>And many more things...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Ra-Software can also adopt applications or application development for your company. 
        If you have problems finding enough skilled developers then we can create modules, 
        parts or entire suites of applications for your company.
    </p>
    <p>
        Think of it this way; Music Artists and Painters don't create their own instruments
        and canvas. So why should not a Software Company out source its software development
        to a Software Factory...?
    </p>
    <p>
        Then your company can do what it knows best, create specifications, talk to customers, 
        market, sell the software. While a highly specialized and extremely skilled Software Factory
        can assemble the software for you. This has been a natural part of conventional business 
        for more then 150 years now, we in Ra-Software think it's time to do this for Software too.
    </p>
    <h2>Power Development</h2>
    <p>
        We do also provide <em>power development</em> if you need to beef up your existing development
        department. We are all highly skilled senior developers and much of the work we do is.
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Coaching other developers</li>
        <li>Ra-Ajax training</li>
        <li>Teaching architecture and software design</li>
        <li>C#, ASP.NET and Ajax training</li>
        <li>Supplying extra hands on projects</li>
        <li>Code Reviews</li>
        <li>Quality Assurance</li>
        <li>Create custom Ajax Controls</li>
        <li>Optimize solutions</li>
        <li>Refactor and clean up code</li>
        <li>Give advice...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>All customers of Ra-Software will be given the rights to use Ra-Ajax within
        their organization in a non-GPL license</strong>, which means that your software will not
        be restricted by the GPL in any ways. As a consulting customer of Ra-Software you
        will get to use Ra-Ajax as you wish within a proprietary license.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to several international studies about 75% of all software projects
        fails in some way or another. Ra-Software does not fail. If we take on ourselves a job
        we know we will be able to deliver the expected results. We can't promise you success,
        money and eternal happines, but we can guarantee that we will not fail on our part 
        - which is the software construction parts!

    </p>
    <h2>Can't afford to hire us?</h2>
    <p>
        Fear not, Ra-Software has a <em>Serve the Underserved Initiative</em> where we can give you
        some time of consultancy very inexpensively which then also includes the proprietary
        license of Ra-Ajax.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of the consultancy given this way would be in the form of access to videos
        and similar concepts. And our <em>Serve the Underserved Initiative</em> is highly dependant
        upon that you really need it. If you're working from home and just registered your 
        company and you still haven't made much buck at all, then you're worthy. If you live in a 
        very poor country where our consultancy rates are too much for you to pay, and your 
        company is really broke, then you're worthy. And if you work for free for a voluntary 
        organization that just wants to help the world you're also worthy. All students would 
        normally be considered worthy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Still you need to tell us about what you're going to do, and it must be a really 
        heartbreaking story! Even though you're a startup we will not give you consulting
        if you're going to build Nuclear Missile Guiding Systems.

    <h1>Software Factory</h1>
    <p>
        Ra-Software, the company behind Ra-Ajax is a <em>Software Factory</em>. This means that
        we can create software for you. In fact we all define ourselves as <em>Software Creators</em>.
        If you need software created or you have some problems which you think that we can solve 
        for you, then please send <a href="mailto:thomas@ra-ajax.org">us an email</a> and explain 
        what you would want us to do.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the things we can do...
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Create web or intranet enterprise applications</li>
        <li>Create intranet or enterprise applications for your company</li>
        <li>Adopt entire suites of web-applications for you</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Then your organization can do what it knows best, create specifications, talk to customers, 
        market and sell your products, etc. While a highly specialized and extremely skilled <em>Software Factory</em>
        can assemble your software. This has been a natural part of conventional industry 
        for more then 150 years, we in Ra-Software think it's time to do this for Software too.
    </p>
    <h2>Why so many Software Project fails...</h2>
    <p>
        Software Development is a craftsmanship-skill many people claim to posess, but few are able to 
        master. Kind of like masonry used to be hundreds of years ago.
        Think of it like this; Music Artists and Painters don't create their own instruments
        or paint and Toys'R'Us and MacDonalds don't manufacture their own toys or grow their own potatoes. 
        So why should not a Software Company have a specialized <em>Software Factory</em> create
        their Software.
    </p>
    <p>
        Or think of it like this; Software is highly complex and difficult to create, so why should
        the process of creating your software be given to randomly chosen self proclaimed Software 
        Developers - whom nobody in your organization are able to evaluate the skills of.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to several international studies about <strong>75% of all software projects
        fails. Ra-Software does not fail</strong>. If we chose to create your software then 
        we know we will be able to deliver the expected results, within the expected budget at the 
        expected time.

        <p>
            <em style="font-size:larger;">
                "Ra-Software delivered our online database component far above expectations: on time, 
                well under industry pricing and well above feature requirements. I recommend anyone who 
                needs Ajax work done to use Ra-Software - it sets a new standard for Ajax applications."
            </em>
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>How we succeed</h2>
    <p>
        First of all we say <b>no</b> to projects where we are uncertain about whether or not we can fulfill our
        guarantee. Second of all we are all extremely seasoned developers with an average of more then 
        20 years of software creation experience. In addition we focus purely on Ajax and Web-Applications.
        We don't spread ourselves around on Desktop Systems, Flash Applications or multiple languages
        and platforms. We focus purely on web-applications, following all the Open Standards out there.
        But most important is that we use our own modular based web-application framework which 
        reduces the development time and increases the quality by orders of magnitudes. In addition we
        create software which ends up with zero licensing costs for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact the tools in addition to our process are at the core of our <em>Software Factory</em> 
        concept and can be thought of as the software version of what Henry Ford did in regards to 
        the car manufacturing industry with his tool; the <em>Conveyor Belt</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We refer to this process and our tools as the <em>Lego Process</em>, which explains
        why we are so confident in our service and its quality. So while most other Software Companies
        are using hammer and chisel to carve software out of the mountain, with all the risks that creates
        on your behalf, we assemble software for you as
        if it was Lego. This gives you an extreme flexibility, orders of magnitudes less development
        time for us which in turn ends up on your behalf as a fraction of the costs and orders of magnitudes
        higher amounts of quality and predictability.
    </p>
    <p>
        That's why we don't even refer to ourselves as <em>System Developers</em> - because what we
        do is not what other development companies are doing. We are <em>Software Creators</em> and our
        company is a <em>Software Factory</em>.

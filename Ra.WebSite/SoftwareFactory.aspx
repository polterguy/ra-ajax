    <p>
        Ra-Software, the company behind Ra-Ajax is a <em>Software Factory</em>. This means that
        we can create software for you. In fact we all define ourselves as <em>Software Creators</em>.
        If you need software created or you have some problems which you think that we can solve 
        for you, then please send <a href="mailto:thomas@ra-ajax.org">us an email</a> and explain 
        what you would want us to do.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the things we can do for you;
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Create new web or intranet enterprise applications</li>
        <li>Move existing desktop based applications onto the web</li>
        <li>Replace your existing system-development department</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Then your organization can do what it knows best, create specifications, talk to customers, 
        market and sell your products, etc. While a highly specialized and extremely skilled <em>Software Factory</em>
        can assemble your software. This has been a natural part of conventional industry 
        for more then 150 years, we in Ra-Software think it's time to do this for Software too.
    </p>
    <h2>Why so many Software Projects fail...</h2>
    <p>
        Software Development is a craftsmanship-skill many people claim to posess, but few are able to 
        master. Kind of like masonry used to be hundreds of years ago.
        Think of it like this; Music Artists and Painters don't create their own instruments
        or paint and Toys'R'Us and MacDonalds don't manufacture their own toys or grow their own potatoes. 
        So why should not a Software Company have a specialized <em>Software Factory</em> create
        their Software.
    </p>
    <p>
        Or think of it like this; Software is highly complex and difficult to create, so why should
        the process of creating your software be given to randomly chosen self proclaimed Software 
        Developers - whom nobody in your organization fully are able to evaluate the skills of.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to several international studies about <strong>75% of all software projects
        fails. Ra-Software does not fail</strong>. If we create your software then 
        we know we will be able to deliver the expected results, within the expected budget at the 
        expected time.

                "Ra-Software delivered our online database component far above expectations: on time, 
                well under industry pricing and well above feature requirements. I recommend anyone who 
                needs Ajax work done to use Ra-Software - it sets a new standard for Ajax applications."

    <h2>How we succeed</h2>
    <p>
        First of all we say <b>no</b> to projects where we are uncertain about whether or not we can deliver the
        expected results. Second of all we are all extremely seasoned developers with an average of more then 
        20 years of software creation experience. In addition we focus purely on Web-Applications, and to
        save you money and increase your flexibility we follow all the Open Standards out there. This translates
        into zero licensing costs for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        But most important is that we use our own modular based web-application framework which 
        seriously reduces the development time and greatly increases the quality of your products.
    </p>
    <p>
        We refer to this process and our tools as the <em>Lego Process</em>, which explains
        why we are so confident in our service and its quality. So while most other Software Companies
        are using hammer and chisel to carve software out of the mountain, with all the risks that creates
        on your behalf, we assemble software for you as
        if it was Lego. This gives you an extreme flexibility, a great deal less development
        time for us, which in turn ends up on your behalf as a fraction of the costs. In addition it 
        also means much better quality and more predictability for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact the tools and our process are at the core of our Software Factory
        concept and can be thought of as the software version of what Henry Ford did to 
        the car manufacturing industry with his tool; the Conveyor Belt.
        When Henry Ford introduced the Conveyor Belt he reduced the time it took to construct a car by
        several orders of magnitudes. The <em>Lego Process</em> just like the Conveyor Belt reduces the 
        time it takes to construct Software by several orders of magnitudes. The Lego Process also eliminates 
        the risk and gives you far more flexibility. This translates into significantly reduced costs for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>We also pride ourselves in that we are constantly improving our technology, tools and processes.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        That's why we don't even refer to ourselves as <em>System Developers</em> - because what we
        do is not what other Software companies are doing. We are <em>Software Creators</em> and our
        company is a <em>Software Factory</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now you know how we work and why it translates into less problems for you. Here's a short-list of 
        what's in it for you;
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Costs reduced to a fraction</li>
        <li>Unmatched flexibility</li>
        <li>Time2Market reduced drastically</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Software Factory</h1>
    <p>
        Ra-Software, the company behind Ra-Ajax is a <em>Software Factory</em>. This means that
        we can create software for you. If you have some piece of software or website you would
        want to create then we can create it for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have some software created or you have some problem which we can solve for you, then please
        send <a href="mailto:thomas@ra-ajax.org">Thomas an email</a> and explain what you would
        want to get done.
    </p>
    <p>
        Things we can do...
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Create websites for your company</li>
        <li>Create applications for your company</li>
        <li>Create modules for an existing website</li>
        <li>Create DotNetNuke modules for you</li>
        <li>And many more things...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Ra-Software can also adopt applications or application development for your company. 
        If you have problems finding enough skilled developers then we can create modules, 
        parts or entire suites of applications for your company.
    </p>
    <p>
        Think of it this way; Music Artists and Painters don't create their own instruments
        and canvas. So why should not a Software Company out source its software development
        to a Software Factory...?
    </p>
    <p>
        Then your company can do what it knows best, create specifications, talk to customers, 
        market, sell the software. While a highly specialized and extremely skilled Software Factory
        can assemble the software for you. This has been a natural part of conventional business 
        for more then 150 years now, we in Ra-Software think it's time to do this for Software too.
    </p>
    <h2>Power Development</h2>
    <p>
        We do also provide <em>power development</em> if you need to beef up your existing development
        department. We are all highly skilled senior developers and much of the work we do is.
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Coaching other developers</li>
        <li>Ra-Ajax training</li>
        <li>Teaching architecture and software design</li>
        <li>C#, ASP.NET and Ajax training</li>
        <li>Supplying extra hands on projects</li>
        <li>Code Reviews</li>
        <li>Quality Assurance</li>
        <li>Create custom Ajax Controls</li>
        <li>Optimize solutions</li>
        <li>Refactor and clean up code</li>
        <li>Give advice...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        According to several international studies about 75% of all software projects
        fails in some way or another. Ra-Software does not fail. If we take on ourselves a job
        we know we will be able to deliver the expected results. We can't promise you success,
        money and eternal happines, but we can guarantee that we will not fail on our part 
        - which is the software construction parts!
    </p>

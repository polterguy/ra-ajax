    <h1>The 5 Pearls of Ra-Software</h1>

    <p>
	    These are the Pillars Ra-Software is built on. Every action we take is measured against
	    these values. These Pillars might not be the reason why we can earn money, but they 
	    definitely are the reason why we want to live. We make sure that all people in
	    Ra-Software have a strong commitment to these values.
    </p>

    <h2>Honor</h2>
    <p>
	    A man without Honor will easily turn to lies to gain personal advantages, he will 
	    decieve others without thinking twice about it, and he will have more focus on personal 
	    gain than helping others and his community. An Honorable man will take great pride in 
	    making large personal sacrifices for others and will never lie to gain personal advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
	    Ra-Software have great focus on Honor, for others this means that we do not tell lies, 
	    we take great pride in helping others, and we don't do things that is incompatible with
	    living an Honorable life. For an Honorable man a promise carries as much weight as his 
	    soul. A man without Honor is a slave to values with no value.
    </p>

    <h2>Courage</h2>
    <p>
	    A man with no courage will stay on the safe path and never go his own ways. He will be 
	    afraid of the dark and the unknown, and always have the opinion of the herd, also where it's 
	    not in neither his nor his peers best interests.
    </p>
    <p>
	    Ra-Software is a courageous company. This makes us able to find alternative and better solutions. 
	    We use existing Best Practices where these are proven, but to find new Best Practices and help the world 
	    evolve, one needs courage to seek away from the safe path. Sheep use only existing trails, 
	    well lit up, Lions are not afraid of the dark and hence can create new pathways, even through 
	    the thickest of the night and hence do not need to walk as far to get to where they want to arrive.
	    A man without courage is a slave to fear.
    </p>

    <h2>Beauty</h2>
    <p>
	    Without Beauty there can be no unity or pride. Millions of people flock to see the Taj Mahal, 
	    the Pyramids and the Golden Gate every year. Beauty is what inspires us to evolve. A beautiful 
	    soul shines with the light of a thousand stars.
    </p>
    <p>
	    Ra-Software seeks out Beauty in all aspects; code, architecture, design and communication. Beauty 
	    is what makes our software easy to understand and use. Beauty is what makes us work as one 
	    unit and gather around higher goals than profit.
    </p>

    <h2>Freedom</h2>
    <p>
	    Men who are willing to trade Freedom for security deserves none. Freedom is a goal. Without
	    Freedom people are not able to evolve and grow. Tyrants come in many shapes, lock-ins, proprietary
	    standards and fear-mongering are some of them.
    </p>
    <p>
	    Ra-Software seeks out Freedom where ever it can be found, that's why we emphasize Open 
	    Standards and Open Source. We do not want people to choose us because they have to, if
	    we cannot be chosen because of our qualities, we do not want to be chosen. We will not lure
	    you into obscure contracts, enslaving you. For us there is not enough money in the world to 
	    sell our souls. A man who enslaves others is not a man, but a tyrant.
    </p>

    <h2>Dedication</h2>
    <p>
        People without commitment and Dedication are like leaves. First breadth of wind and 
        they'll fly away. With Dedication comes strength. With Dedication comes the strength to 
        not give up.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ra-Software does not give up. That is why we are so carefully choosing who we want to
        work with. We would rather sink to the bottom of the ocean than failing to Honor 
        a promise.
    </p>

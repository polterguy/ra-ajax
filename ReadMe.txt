                Ra-Ajax - A Managed Ajax Library for ASP.NET and Mono

**********************************************************************************************

* Ra-Ajax is licensed under the MITx11 License.

* The pre-built library DLLs exist within the "binaries" folder and
  are the ones that should be used in your projects since they are
  minified and optimized.

* The "Ra.Build.Tasks" project contains custom NAnt build tasks to 
  minify and GZip JavaScript and CSS. Feel free to use it in 
  your own projects.

* If you wish to rebuild the library this must be done using NAnt
  and the "Ra.build" script which will minify the JS for you using
  the "Ra.Build.Tasks.dll".

* If you just want to test Ra-Ajax locally then for Windows systems
  this can be easily done by opening the Ra.sln file in Visual Studio
  and hitting F5 to start the Samples website.
  In Mono on Linux use the xsp2 command from a command line within the
  samples directory and browse to http://localhost:8080/


Have a nice day :)
